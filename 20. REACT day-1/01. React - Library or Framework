REACT:
------

---> React - Library or Framework?

---> Components - reusable and independent

---> DOM - Document Object Model
     Document Object Model is a programming interface for HTML documents. 
     It is used to represent the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content
     DOM is created by the browser when a web page is loaded. 
     In graphical form, it's like a tree of elements also called nodes, which are used to represent every single element on the page. 
     All the DOM of our webpage sits inside the document object. 
     Programmatically, this model allows us to read or even change the content of our page via JavaScript.
     This process of making changes to the HTML elements using Javascript through the DOM is known as DOM manipulation.
     The main reason we include JavaScript in our HTML is to add instructions on how it should respond to an action taken on the browser. In other words, to add            interactivity on the page.
     Your job as a JavaScript front end developer is to select and update the DOM elements when a user interacts with a website. DOM is what lets you do this using          JavaScript.
     
     
     Actions of DOM in JavaScript?
     - Change/Remove HTML elements in the DOM/on the page.
     - Change and add CSS styles to elements
     - Read and change attributes (href, src, alt), etc.
     - Create new elements and insert them into the DOM/page.
     - Attach event listeners to elements (click, keypress, submit)
     
     Four kinds of nodes in a DOM tree?
     - Document Node - Represent the entire page which contains multiple elements in it. 
     - Element Node- Represent each HTML tag that are used in the HTML code. 
     - Attribute Node - These are nodes to model  the attribute of HTML elements, for instance <img src = â€œ â€ width = â€œâ€ alt = â€œâ€ > 
     - Text Node - These are the text content of the HTML element. 
     
     
     - getElementById()- method returns the element that contains the name id passed. And in case we do not have any id with that specific name, it returns null.
     - querySelector()-method returns the first Element within the document that matches the specified selector, or group of selectors. If no matches are found, null          is returned.
     - getElementsByClassName()-method returns an HTMLCollection of all those elements containing the specific name class passed.
     - getElementsByTagName()-method returns an HTMLCollection of all those elements with the tag name passed.
     - querySelectorAll()-method returns all elements in the document that matches a specified CSS selector(s), as a static NodeList object. The NodeList object              represents a collection of nodes. The nodes can be accessed by index numbers. 
     
     
     How to alter(change) values and properties? 
     - Altering a specific text node:You use the property "nodeValue" and â€œtextContentâ€ to access or update content of a text node
     - Working with HTML content: when you want to add, update or remove blocks of HTML code from your page, you use the methods like createElement(), innerHTML,              textContent, appendChild() and removeChild().
     - Working with attributes:when you want to add, update or remove the attribute value of an element, you use the methods like className, classList, id,                    hasAttribute(), getAttribute(), setAttribute(), removeAttribute().
     - to select an individual element by traversing between multiple elements, You can traverse from one element to another by using properties like parentNode,              previousElementSibling, nextElementSibling,firstElementChild and lastElementChild.

     



---> Virtual DOM - 
     Virtual DOM is a logic that React uses to increase the speed of its application.
     It is a copy of the original DOM. 
     2 states: i) previous state
               ii) next state
     Only refrehes elements on which changes have been made. These changes occur only on the virtual DOM not in the Real DOM. 
     Only changed elements get updated in Original DOM.
     So this prevents making unnecessary calls to the server which in turn increases the speed of the Application.
     
     
---> JSX - JavaScript XML. 
     Instead of putting JavaScript into HTML,
     JSX allows us to put HTML into JavaScript.
     It is simply a syntax extension of React. 
     
     
---> React - Single Page Application
     - A Single Page Application is a web application or website that interacts with the web browser by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from          the web server, instead of the default method of the browser loading entire new pages. This means that the URL of your website will not change completely (page        will not reload), instead it will keep getting content and rewriting the DOM with it instead of loading a new page.     
     - The goal is faster transitions that make the website feel more like a native app.
     - In Technical Terms:
       When building your react-app, you can see that there is only one App.js from where your entire web-app is loaded in fragments and components. This behaviour of        rendering components and pages on a single page and changing the DOM( is a single page behaviour and hence the name), instead of loading a new page with new            content, this makes it feel like a single application.
     
     
     
 
 NPM:
 ----
 
 ---> Npm - Node Package Manager
     - npm is a open source platform from where we can install all the libraries. Open source means anyone can download any package from here or upload any package to it.
     - React is a library and this library is stored in npm. So React is installed using this npm or from this npm.
     - When Node is installed in our system, npm automatically gets installed.
     - Node --> npm --> react library
     - A developer creates a library, uploads it to any open source platform so that other developers can download it and can use it.
     
 ---> Yarn
     - yarn is yet another open source platform to install libraries like npm. Both serves the same purpose.
     - yarn is also developed by Facebook, React is also developed by Facebook.
     - yarn was developed after npm. It is little bit faster than npm.
     - yarn itself is available inside npm only.
     - Node --> npm --> yarn --> react library
