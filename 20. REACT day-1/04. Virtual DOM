---> Virtual DOM - 

     Virtual DOM is a logic that React uses to increase the speed of its application.
     It is a copy of the original DOM. 
     2 states: i) previous state
               ii) next state
     Only refrehes elements on which changes have been made. These changes occur only on the virtual DOM not in the Real DOM. 
     Only changed elements get updated in Original DOM.
     So this prevents making unnecessary calls to the server which in turn increases the speed of the Application.
