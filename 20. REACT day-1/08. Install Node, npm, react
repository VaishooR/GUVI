--> Install Node js in your system and to check if installed, use these commands in the cmd prompt to check if it is successfully installed.
       node -v
       npm -v
 
--> npm commands:

   --> global installation: package gets installed in the root folder.
   --> local installation: package gets installed in a local folder that the user mentions.
 
   i) npm root -g
      -g mentions installing globally. Which means, when a package is installed, using -g installs the package in the root folder. Root folder is the folder where the 
      Node has been installed in our system.
      - so this command is used to find the root folder path.
