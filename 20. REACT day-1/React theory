---> React - Library or Framework?

---> Components - reusable and independent

---> DOM - Document Object Model
     Document Object Model is a programming interface for HTML documents. 
     It is used to represent the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content
     DOM is created by the browser when a web page is loaded. 
     In graphical form, it's like a tree of elements also called nodes, which are used to represent every single element on the page. 
     All the DOM of our webpage sits inside the document object. 
     Programmatically, this model allows us to read or even change the content of our page via JavaScript.
     This process of making changes to the HTML elements using Javascript through the DOM is known as DOM manipulation.


---> Virtual DOM - 
     Virtual DOM is a logic that React uses to increase the speed of its application.
     It is a copy of the original DOM. 
     2 states: i) previous state
               ii) next state
     Only refrehes elements on which changes have been made. These changes occur only on the virtual DOM not in the Real DOM. 
     Only changed elements get updated in Original DOM.
     So this prevents making unnecessary calls to the server which in turn increases the speed of the Application.
