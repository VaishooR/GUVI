---> So to go to another component, both <Link> or useNavigate() hook can be used. In navigate the 'to' value of <Link> has to be mentioned.
     But using useNavigate, we can also send data to another component.
     
---> Navigate function takes two parameters. i) path to the component it has to go on clicking.
                                             ii) data to be sent in the form of object of objects.
                                                 To send the data, we use 'state' keyword.
     Syntax: { () => navigate( (" "), { state : {name: ' ', age: ' '} } ) }
