Router:
-------

---> Routers are used to navigate between components.
---> To achieve this, we use the 'react-router-dom' package.

     npm i react-router-dom
     import {BrowserRouter,Routes,Route} from 'react-router-dom';
     
     

---> We can create multiple components(i.e functions) in a single page. But only one component can be made 'default' export.


---> 'path' and 'element' are the props that we are giving to the <Route> component.
     'to' is the props we are giving to <Link> component.
      The 'path' and 'to' has to be same.
