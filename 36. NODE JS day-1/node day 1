---> Frontend javascript: Javascript that runs by interpreting the browser is known as frontend js.
                          Javascript depends on the browser to run, only because it contains V8 engine(chrome).
                          To make javascript independent of browser, a copy of V8 engine was taken out and made as a seperate server.
                          Now Javascript program runs independently on the terminal, without depending on browsers. This independent js program is known as Node js.
