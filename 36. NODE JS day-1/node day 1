node day 1


---> Frontend javascript: Javascript that runs by interpreting the browser is known as frontend js.
                          Javascript depends on the browser to run, only because it contains V8 engine(chrome).
                          V8 engine is a open source js engine, developed by google.
                          To make javascript independent of browser, a copy of V8 engine was taken out and made as a seperate server.
                          Now Javascript program runs independently on the terminal, without depending on browsers. This independent js program is known as Node js.

---> Node Js: is a server side Javascript library.
              was created by Ryan Dahl in 2009.
              is a single threaded application which makes it lighter and faster.
              uses event driven & a non-blocking i/o model.
              Event driven means event queue, worker threads.
              
              
---> How Nodejs works:

     Application --> V8 engine --> Event Queue --> Event Loop --> worker thread( if it is a blocking code) --> sends a callback to Event Loop.
     Application <-- V8 engine <-- Event Queue <-- Event Loop(if non-blocking)
     
     Once worker thread completes the asynch codes, sends a call back to event loop.
     Event loop gives priorty to worker thread's callbacks and excecutes those codes.
