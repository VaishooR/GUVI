---> Controlled forms: Everything has to handled by the state variables.
                  So each and every time when we make changes to the input, it gets updated in the state variable.


---> e.preventDefault() prevents automatic page refresh and also prevents the form values being displayed as query parameters.

---> Form validation is necessary to prevent the Form from being submitted with empty inputs.

---> If we want to use the 'key' in a dynamic way, we use square brackets.  ex: { [e.target.name] : e.target.value}
